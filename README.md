Students and employees will be required to provide a number of documents in 2023 as a
result of the collaboration and accreditation requirements the university is undertaking.
Both full-time and part-time lecturers are kindly asked to submit their supporting
documentation. Lack of an information management system for the papers will make it
more difficult to retrieve them quickly. Information from this document should be saved and
matched to the actual, physical document. In other words, this is a project to create a miniarchive that can organize and accept different types of papers for easier access.
The goal is to create software that can handle many types of documents, save them, and
provide easy access to them for tasks like editing, printing, and reading, to mention a few.
The documents ought to be organized by faculty, department, instructor and other criteria.
